Starving Student Tube Headphone Amplifier

Based on the design files available here: http://www.diyforums.org/SSMH/SSMHoverview.php

Configured to use the commonly available 12AU7 tubes instead of the original 19J6 tubes that are now hard to find.

Also added 2 blue LEDs to run from the main 48V DC input. As long as the supply is 350mA+, this should not be an issue. Some people add these across the heater bias instead to be lower power.
